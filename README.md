Data Analytics Project Showcasing Customer behavior analysis using python, sql, power bi
# Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **data analytics workflow** using Python, SQL, and Power BI. The goal is to extract insights from raw data through exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, database querying, and dashboard visualization. The final insights are presented through a Power BI dashboard, a written report, and a presentation created using Gamma.

This project is designed to showcase **job-ready data analyst skills** in a clear and recruiter-friendly way.

## Dataset

* **Source:** CSV / Excel / Database extract (replace with actual source)
* **Type:** Structured data
* **Description:** Contains business-related data such as sales, customers, products, revenue, and time-based metrics (customize as per your dataset)
* **Size:** (Number of rows and columns)

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python:** Data loading, cleaning, and EDA

  * Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **SQL:** Data querying and analysis

  * Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server
* **Power BI:** Interactive dashboard creation
* **Gamma:** Presentation (PPT) creation
* **Jupyter Notebook:** Development environment

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Loading

* Loaded dataset into Python using Pandas
* Verified schema, data types, and missing values

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Summary statistics
* Distribution analysis
* Trend and pattern identification
* Outlier detection

### 3. Data Cleaning

* Handled missing values
* Removed duplicates
* Corrected data types
* Treated outliers where necessary

### 4. SQL Analysis

* Imported cleaned data into SQL database
* Wrote SQL queries using:

  * SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY
  * JOINs
  * Aggregations
  * Subqueries (if applicable)

### 5. Dashboard Creation (Power BI)

* Connected Power BI to SQL / cleaned dataset
* Created KPIs and visuals
* Built interactive filters and slicers

### 6. Reporting & Presentation

* Summarized insights in a report
* Created a professional presentation using Gamma

## Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides:

* Key performance indicators (KPIs)
* Trend analysis over time
* Category-wise and region-wise breakdowns
* Interactive filters for deeper analysis

(Screenshot or link to dashboard can be added here)

## Key Results & Insights

* Identified major trends and patterns in the data
* Highlighted top-performing and underperforming segments
* Discovered data-driven insights to support business decisions

(Replace with 3–5 actual insights from your project)
